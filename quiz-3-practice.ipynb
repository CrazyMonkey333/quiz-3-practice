Professor Willow has collected information about all different sorts of Pokémon around the world and it's up to you to figure out what about a  Pokémon makes it a Pikachu. Professor Willow also was kind enough to leave you a data dictionary of all the information he collected [here](./data-dic.txt). Good luck!"
